# Brand Pills
I needed some brand pills for a project, so quickly made this.
It's super simple, I'll update this ReadMe with an example / implementation later.

# Stuff to do 
- Add more customisation ( ability to toggle icons, a dark mode / light mode styling )
- For pill's without an appropriate icon, I'll attempt to use a "generic one" - i.e cloud hosting's should use a cloud etc
- publish it on NPM and try using it on a project.
